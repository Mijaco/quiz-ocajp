### Design

The whole demo application is divided into components each component holds it's own styling and template along with the logic.

`Models` represent the basic types for eg. `Question` & `Choice`.

`AppComponent` is the basic skeleton of the project.

`ChoiceComponent` and `QuestionComponent` contain the html, css & typescript for `Choice` & `Question` respectively.

Data is taken dummy-data.ts file which is present in `JSON` format. 

### Implementation

Application gets initialised in the application component which passes data to the `QuestionComponent` which is primarily a question 
object.

This component gets rendered inside the carousel component which is a part of the (ngx-bootstrap)[test](https://google.com) library.


### Accessibility

I have assigned `alt` attribute in the image tags across the templates.


### Future scope

* Support for arrow key navigation.
* Support for alpha key choice selection.
